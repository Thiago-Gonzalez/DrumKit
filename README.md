<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>There are 7 different buttons that, when clicked or pressed, as indicated by the letter on the button, reproduce the different sounds that a drum can play. So if you press the letters 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', and 'l' or the buttons, each will produce a different sound associated with it.</p>
